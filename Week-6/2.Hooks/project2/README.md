# Two jargons:
    1. Side effects - In React, the concept of side effects encompasses any operations that reach outside the functional scope of a React component.
                    - These operations can affect other components, interact with the browser, or perform asynchronous data fetching.
                    - Basically anything not related to rendering cycle in React. 
                    - E.g. Fecthing data from database, etc.
    2. Hooks - They are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features without wrting a class.
             - They enable functional components to have access to stateful logic and lifecycle features, which were previously only possible in class components.
             - This has to led to a more concise and readable way of writing components in React.
