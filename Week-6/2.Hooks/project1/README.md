# Hooks

    - Until now we have already discussed 'useState'.
    - These functions that start with 'use' are called hooks.
    - Hooks in React are functions that allow you to "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.
    - E.g. useEffect, useMemo, useCallback, useRef, useReducer, useContext, useLayoutEffect
