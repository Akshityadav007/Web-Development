Clone the github repo from week 13 of 100x devs, then:

**Step 1** => Use 'npm install $(cat packages.txt)' to install all packages.
**Step 2** =>  Run 'npm run build to get your 'dist' folder created. (Because we run .js files on node not .ts)

- Run 'npx tsc' everytime you amend .ts file

Remember to refresh ca.crt every month(node.js requires certificate verification).
Also I have updated the utils.ts as Harkirat is using elephant postgres which is now deprecated. Am using tembo.
