# State Management
    - It is a cleaner way to store the data of your app.
    - Until now, the cleanest thing you can do is use the Context API.
    - Context API lets you teleport state.
    - But there are better solutions that get rid of the problems that Context API has (unnecessary re-renders).


    - State management in React is the process of handling and sharing data (or "state") across components. 
    - React uses component-based architecture, where each component can maintain its own local state, but managing state becomes challenging as the application grows and components need to share data.

    - State management can be done through various approach (when to Use Which Approach):
        1. Component state(Each component can hold its own state using the useState hook): For local, component-specific state.
        2. Lifting state up(prop): When sibling components need to share state.
        3. Context API: For managing global state across multiple, deeply nested components.
        4. Third-party libraries(Recoil, Redux, Zustand, etc.): When your app has complex state requirements, involving actions,reducers, or advanced data sharing.

# Recoil
    - Recoil simplifies the process of managing global state in a React application by offering features that make it easy to share state between components, handle asynchronous state, and create dependencies between different pieces of state.
    - Key Features of Recoil
        1. Atoms:
            - Atoms are units of state in Recoil, similar to individual pieces of state in React's useState.
            - Any component that subscribes to an atom will re-render when the atom's state changes.
            - Atoms can be accessed and updated by any component in the application.
        2. Selectors:
            - Selectors are functions that compute derived state based on atom values or other selectors. 
            - Think of them as computed properties that allow you to transform or derive new values from atoms.
            - They can be used to compute values on the fly or filter data.
        3. Recoil Root:
            - To use Recoil in your app, you need to wrap your component tree in a RecoilRoot, which acts like the provider for Recoil's global state.
        4. Asynchronous State Management:
            - Recoil natively supports asynchronous state. With selectors, you can handle fetching data or any other async operations and have it seamlessly integrate with your React components.
