    1. Single page applications
        - React websites are single page applications.
        - When we send a request, we receive a page. 
        - If we want to send another request, we get a hard reload while receiving another page.
        - Hence, we need to learn routing to be able to handle it.
        - This way we can either get all the website code at once, or we can bundle(shove all code in one js file) it.

    2. Client side bundle
        - The big bundle of code(js) which we get on the client side.

    3. Client side routing
        - The code that you write as the developer to show them the content of the webpage (landing page, messages page, feed page, etc.)
