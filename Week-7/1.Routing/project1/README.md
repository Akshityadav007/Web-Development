# Routing
    - Routes in React.js define the mapping between the URL paths and the components that should be rendered for those paths.
    - We perform routing using 'react-router-dom'.

    - In this project we will do basic routing. Feel free to explore more on the reference website.

    * Note : run 'npm install react-router-dom'.

    - We use 'useNavigate()' hook to navigate across routes to avoid hard reload.
