# Prop Drilling
    - Prop drilling is a concept in React where data is passed down from a parent component to child components through props. 
    - This can lead to a situation where props are passed through multiple layers of components, even if some of those components don't need the data themselves. 
    - This can make the code harder to manage, especially in larger applications, as you may have to pass props through many components just to get them to the one that needs them.
