# Context API
    - This lets you fix prop drilling.
    - The Context API in React is a powerful feature that allows you to share values (like data or functions) across your component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level(prop drilling). 
    - This is especially useful for global data that needs to be accessed by multiple components, such as themes, user authentication, or language settings.
