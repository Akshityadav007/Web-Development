-> While performing a 'chmod' to a file:

The sum of these numbers represents the permissions granted:
    0 = no permissions (---)
    1 = execute only (--x)
    2 = write only (-w-)
    3 = write and execute (-wx)
    4 = read only (r--)
    5 = read and execute (r-x)
    6 = read and write (rw-)
    7 = read, write, and execute (rwx)

E.g. chmod 664 file_name
    this will give , owner 6th, group 6th, others 4th permission from the above list.
