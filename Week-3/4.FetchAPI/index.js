/*
    -> The Fetch API in JavaScript is a modern way to make network requests, replacing older methods like XMLHttpRequest.
    -> It provides a more powerful and flexible feature set for working with HTTP requests and responses.

    Key Features:
    -> Promises-based: fetch returns a Promise, making it easy to handle asynchronous code.
    -> CORS: Fetch API respects the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy.
    -> Response Formats: You can handle different response types like JSON, text, blob, etc.

    Error Handling:
    -> The fetch function only rejects a Promise if there's a network error. 
    -> For other HTTP errors (e.g., 404, 500), you need to manually check the response status as shown in the examples above.

// Fetch was introduced in HTML way. It was used to show how we connect frontend with backend while making an API call using Fetch.
