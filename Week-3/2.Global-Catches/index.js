/*
    1. Error-handling middleware: 
       -> This is specific to Express. 
       -> It catches errors that occur within the request-response lifecycle and is invoked when next(err) is called. 
       -> Itâ€™s designed to handle errors across routes and middleware in an Express app.

    2. Global catches (try-catch): 
       -> This is general JavaScript error handling. 
       -> When using async functions, unhandled errors in promises need to be caught manually.
       -> You wrap async code in a try-catch block and pass the error to the Express error handler using next(err).



    => In Express.js, error-handling middleware catches and processes errors thrown during the request-response cycle.
    => To define one, create a middleware function with four parameters: (err, req, res, next). 
    => This middleware should be placed after all other routes and middleware in the stack.
