    We will see debouncing and throttling in this.
    1. Debouncing : 
        -> Debouncing ensures that a function is invoked after a certain period of inactivity. 
        -> The function is only called after the specified delay time has passed without any new events triggering it again.
        -> This is done in order to save the browser from making unnecessary calls.

    2. Throttling:
        -> Throttling ensures that a function is invoked at regular intervals, regardless of how many events are triggered.
        -> It limits the rate of execution to a set interval.
    
    => So, here we won't be using the button to get the sum, we'll see how to implement debouncing and throttling for this.
    -> Using debouncing we can get the sum when the user stops typing after certain period (1000ms in this case).
