1. Flex
    - display: flex is a CSS property that makes an element a flex container.
    - It enables the children (flex items) to align and distribute space dynamically.
    - With flexbox, you can control the layout direction, item alignment, spacing, and item sizing easily within the container.

2. Grid
    - display: grid is a CSS property that turns an element into a grid container.
    - It allows you to create complex, two-dimensional layouts with rows and columns.
    - You can define the structure using grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns, and place child elements (grid items) in specific grid cells or areas for more precise positioning.

3. Responsiveness
    - Bascially how the website reacts on display size change.


**Note** : 
- Similar to bootstrap, tailwind also is a CSS framework with it's own way of defining properties.
- Hence, we will need to look into it's docs every now and then to use it.
- We need to install tailwind first to use it.
